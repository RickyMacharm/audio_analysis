# Audio Analysis with Python

These scripts and modules form a simple, yet somewhat scalable approach to audio analysis with Python. The modules are organized as follows:
- common: functionality shared by the other modules
- features: audio feature extraction
- learning: using machine learning to generalize to future audio
- recording: record audio for training and testing machine learning models
- visualization: visualize audio streams in the time and spectral domains

# Motivation

Digital signal processing theory can get dry, but its applications are numerous and exciting!

# Installation

Clone and run! This project has not matured enough to have a formal installation process.

This package uses the [Essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia) C++ audio feature extraction library under the hood, which necessitates Python 2 as the driver.
