# Audio Analysis with Python

These scripts and modules form a simple, yet somewhat scalable approach to audio analysis with Python. The modules are organized as follows:
- common: functionality shared by the other modules
- features: audio feature extraction
- learning: using machine learning to generalize to future audio
- recording: record audio for training and testing machine learning models
- display: visualize audio streams in the time and spectral domains

# Motivation

A real-time audio analysis & visualization library for Python. Naturally, a lot of applications in audio analysis cannot be made real-time (especially in Python). However, it is very instructive and pleasing to view transforms and their variants in real-time.

# Visualization Snapshot

For basic visualization, `visualize.py` samples your microphone in real-time to create a magnitude plot and spectrogram.
